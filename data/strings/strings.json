But nay, the chaos and crises of the Sector, the loneliness of being homeless and the sadness of facing danger head-on are gradually eating away at us. We are almost isolated and untrusted, wandering alone in the darkness of the universe. The outward attitude of the Idoneus Citadel, as it has been for centuries, has inflicted a number of cascading effects on our reputation as well. We have wondered, if even the most refined merchants do not want to have anything to do with us, is it our destiny to go to the grave with our memories? \"\n\" until we met, and as such everyone from the head logistician to the workshop handyman cannot praise you enough for your selfless help. Your ability to support us in what has been considered a pipe dream has also been more than recognised - even the last Chief Commander believed that you could lead us to a better future while preserving our spirit. \"\n\"A settlement as meaningful to us as a milestone has been chosen, a place where people like us who do not want to hold on to our scraps can rest in peace, and where the so-called 'exile' should move forward in a more secure manner. But until then, all of us have agreed to initiate a request-\"\n\n You tap on that letterhead pattern on the communication interface, and all that is shown to you is a single sentence. \n\n\"Do you wish to help us maintain this home?\"",
