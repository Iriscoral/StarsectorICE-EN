Your ability to support us in what has been considered a pipe dream has also been more than recognised - even the last Chief Commander believed that you could lead us to a better future while preserving our spirit. \"\n\"A settlement as meaningful to us as a milestone has been chosen, a place where people like us who do not want to hold on to our scraps can rest in peace, and where the so-called 'exile' should move forward in a more secure manner.
