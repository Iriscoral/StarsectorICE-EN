Six months have passed, the colony ship Progeny, finally changed from a blueprint to a reality. Almost no one can imagine that these oppressed dissidents could unite to complete such a huge project under the eyes of the Idoneus Garrison.

The convoys that had been prepared or temporarily joined, were quietly assembled. And the nebulae around the Eos Exdus star system were enough to mask the scanning of high-intensity sensors.But at the last moment, the abnormal behavior was finally exposed to the patrol. Soon, the Idoneus blockade fleet came to this gathering place.

There was no time for hesitation, and the leader of the dissident or exile, decided to start the grand escape immediately. However, the unexpected guests are impossible to avoid, a hard fight is inevitable. Before facing up to these pursuers, the exiles uploaded the blueprint of this design called "Shalom" to a secret server, so that even if the success is about to be achieved, it will eventually benefit other people with this intention.

Can we eventually found a home of our own in this flawless sector?
